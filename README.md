# Pomodoro Timer

This is a simple pomodoro timer website built with _Next.js_, _Zustand_ and _Material UI_. The website allows you to set a timer for a 25-minute pomodoro session, followed by a 5-minute break. You can also customize the duration of the pomodoro and break sessions. The app is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed at [`https://nextjs-zustand-pomodoro-timer.vercel.app`](https://nextjs-zustand-pomodoro-timer.vercel.app)

## Technologies used

The project was built with the following technologies:

- Next.js: a React framework for building server-side rendered web applications.
- TypeScript: a statically-typed superset of JavaScript.
- Zustand: a lightweight state management library.
- Material UI: a popular React component library for building user interfaces.

This will run all the tests in the project.
