# Pomodoro Timer

This is a simple pomodoro timer website built with *Next.js*, *Zustand* and *Material UI*,. The website allows you to set a timer for a 25-minute pomodoro session, followed by a 5-minute break. You can also customize the duration of the pomodoro and break sessions.

## Technologies used 

The project was built with the following technologies:

- Next.js: a React framework for building server-side rendered web applications.
- TypeScript: a statically-typed superset of JavaScript.
- Zustand: a lightweight state management library.
- Material UI: a popular React component library for building user interfaces.
- Sass: a CSS preprocessor that makes it easy to create reusable styles.

### Testing 

The project includes tests for the Zustand store using **Jest** and **React Testing Library**. To run the tests, you can use:

```npm run test```

This will run all the tests in the project.
